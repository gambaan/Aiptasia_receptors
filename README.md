Aiptasia Receptor Quantification Workflow and FIJI Macro Set

The complete pipeline, along with all necessary FIJI macros for quantifying channels, segmenting images, and determining cell numbers, is available in the FIJI pipeline. Macros are individually numbered for each subsequent analysis, and it is crucial to execute them in the specified order for accurate results.
